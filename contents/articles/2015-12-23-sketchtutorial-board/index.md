Firstly, thank you to everyone who’s reached out to me in the past 24 hours. I never expected such overwhelming support. To those of you who have experienced very similar things, I hope it helps to know you’re not alone - it’s the whole reason I decided to publish [yesterday’s post](http://www.mennenia.com/articles/2015-12-23-goodbye2015/). 

The second most common thing I heard was: “That visionboard is really neat! How do I make one?” So I made a screencast to show you how. 

## How to make a grid of cool images in Sketch

I actually already made my 2016 board a few days ago, so it was easy for me to film the process. The screencast will walk you through all the steps. You’ll get a sneak peak of my next post: my goals for next year! 😉

Essentially you need a bunch of images that you’d like to use and you think represent whichever goals you have. I often use [Pinterest], but have also been known to dip into [Unsplash].

You can also create your own from your own photography or from combining your favourite quotes and typography using a host of different apps: [Over], [Post], and more. 

I then used Sketch to make it into the full image you’ll see featured on the blog shortly. Essentially I calculate the size of each image, and then create rectangles for each. These will mask the images, once I start incorporating those. Easy! :)

## Setting goals

I am a big believer of setting goals and having constant reminders of them. I feel like New Years Resolutions have gotten a bad rep, but that is often because they don’t last very long. People take on too many things at the same time, and burn out from them just a few weeks in. No wonder they’re considered a joke. The practice of setting them, and improving on yourself isn’t though! 

What I tend to do with these boards is put in a few daily rituals that I would like to shape, for instance meditating regularly. The visual representation reminds me of it throughout the year, so I don’t forget to try and do it as often as I can. Surely, it may not be every day, but at least I’m still working on it come June. 

The second thing I urge you to consider are some goals you can easily tick off or where the result is obvious. For instance, getting a driver’s license or going to a specific country. Once you’ve done that, you can see how you’re starting to make progress. It also means that you don’t have to focus on all of these right now. I have the reminder that at some point in the year I want to take driving lessons, but it doesn’t have to be January. It could be July. 

It’s also why I like to put 23 goals down: they’re supposed to last the whole year and they’re supposed to be a bit of a stretch. I’d rather fail a few, but have completed most, than setting myself only 6, say. 

Take from this what you will, but it’s worked for me for quite a while ☺️.

If you end up making any, I’d love to see them. Let’s make 2016 an awesome year for self-improvement!
