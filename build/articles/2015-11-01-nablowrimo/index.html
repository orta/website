<p>I’ve keenly followed <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writing Month) since I was fourteen or so, but never participated. I didn’t have ideas for a novel, I was too busy, something unexpected came up, you name&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>This year, I decided to change it up a bit. Instead of worrying about a novel, I’d tackle another writing project I’ve been wanting to get around to for <em>years</em>. My&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Having had an on-and-off blog for as long as I can remember, it’s been too long without one. I briefly dabbled in a new wordpress one earlier this year (with too many unreleased posts), until <a href="http://honzadvorsky.com">Honza</a> convinced me that something light and simple like <a href="http://wintersmith.io">Wintersmith</a> was really the way&nbsp;forward. </p>
<p>It wasn’t just about the tools though. What I realised put me off blogging for so long is that whenever I read something back, it just didn’t seem right. You know that feeling when you hear yourself back on a recording? And your voice just sounds <em>off</em>? That’s what I have every. single.&nbsp;time. </p>
<p>So, welcome November 2015. The month where I, hopefully, find my writing&nbsp;voice.</p>
<h2 id="nablowrimo-the-rules">NaBloWriMo - The&nbsp;Rules</h2>
<p>NaNoWriMo has a simple definition: one month, 50,000 words. Oh, and it should be&nbsp;fiction.</p>
<p>So what will National Blog Writing Month be about? I eventually settled on the&nbsp;following:</p>
<h3 id="words">Words</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write at least one paragraph each&nbsp;day</li>
<li>Publish a post every week (so you end up with four at the end of the&nbsp;month)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the basics, don’t change&nbsp;anything</li>
<li>Tweak one thing a&nbsp;day</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
Designed to not take more than half an hour a day, it’s all about being set up for succes. A challenge we should all be able to take on,&nbsp;right? </p>
<p>And if you’re really keen, tweet (<code>#NaBloWriMo</code>) letting the world know you wrote your paragraph for the&nbsp;day!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start">How to&nbsp;start</h2>
<p>Set up a blog on a platform of your choosing. Edit the <em>bare minimum</em>. Delete the boilerplate posts, change the title, and maybe, just maybe, change the background colour. That’s&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Then focus on publishing one&nbsp;post. </p>
<p>This one post could be anything. An introduction to yourself. The reason why you’d like to blog. A tour of the city you currently live in and your favourite restaurants. What you had for dinner last night. Pictures of your dog. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you write down some words and share&nbsp;them. </p>
<p>For me, it’s this one. And hopefully one that will inspire you to join me in this&nbsp;challenge!</p>
